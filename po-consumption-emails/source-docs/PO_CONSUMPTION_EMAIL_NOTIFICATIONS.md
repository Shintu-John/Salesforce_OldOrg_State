### 4. Flow: Order_Consumption_Multi_Threshold_Notification

**Deploy ID**: 0AfSj000000yk3BKAQ ✅
**Status**: Active
**Trigger**: When Order record is updated (After Save)

**Flow Elements**:

1. **Get Custom Setting Record**
   - Looks up PO_Notification_Settings__c by PO ID
   - Stores result in variable

2. **Decision: Is PO Enabled?**
   - Checks if Notifications_Enabled__c = TRUE
   - If NO → Flow ends
   - If YES → Continue

3. **Decision: Check Notification Mode**
   - Checks Use_Repeated_Reminders__c
   - FALSE → One-Time Mode (Option B)
   - TRUE → Repeated Mode (placeholder - see Known Limitations)

4. **Option B Reset Logic** (One-Time Mode Path)
   - Updates all 3 checkbox fields using formulas
   - Formula logic: `IF(Consumption < Threshold, FALSE, CurrentCheckboxValue)`
   - Automatically unchecks flags when consumption drops below thresholds

5. **Check 90% Threshold**
   - Condition: Consumption >= 90% AND Notified_90_Percent__c = FALSE
   - Action: Send 90% email
   - Update: Set Notified_90_Percent__c = TRUE

6. **Check 75% Threshold**
   - Condition: Consumption >= 75% AND < 90% AND Notified_75_Percent__c = FALSE
   - Action: Send 75% email
   - Update: Set Notified_75_Percent__c = TRUE

7. **Check 50% Threshold**
   - Condition: Consumption >= 50% AND < 75% AND Notified_50_Percent__c = FALSE
   - Action: Send 50% email
   - Update: Set Notified_50_Percent__c = TRUE

**Formulas**:

```javascript
// fxResetIfBelow50
IF({!$Record.Consumed_Amount_Percent__c} < 0.5,
   false,
   {!$Record.Notified_50_Percent__c})

// fxResetIfBelow75
IF({!$Record.Consumed_Amount_Percent__c} < 0.75,
   false,
   {!$Record.Notified_75_Percent__c})

// fxResetIfBelow90
IF({!$Record.Consumed_Amount_Percent__c} < 0.9,
   false,
   {!$Record.Notified_90_Percent__c})
```

## How It Works

### Option B: Automatic Reset Logic

This is the **current active behavior**.

#### Example Scenario: 55% → 45% → 60%

**Step 1: PO reaches 55% consumption**
```
Consumed_Amount__c: £34,650 (55% of £63,000)
Flow Execution:
  1. Get Custom Setting → Found PO_00059438
  2. Check if enabled → YES
  3. Reset Logic:
     - 55% >= 50%? YES → Keep Notified_50_Percent__c as-is
     - 55% >= 75%? NO → Reset Notified_75_Percent__c = FALSE
     - 55% >= 90%? NO → Reset Notified_90_Percent__c = FALSE
  4. Check 90%: NO (55% < 90%)
  5. Check 75%: NO (55% < 75%)
  6. Check 50%: YES (55% >= 50% AND < 75% AND Notified_50_Percent__c = FALSE)
  7. Send 50% email to all 4 recipients ✅
  8. Set Notified_50_Percent__c = TRUE

Result: Email sent, checkbox marked
```

**Step 2: PO drops to 45% consumption**
```
Consumed_Amount__c: £28,350 (45% of £63,000)
Flow Execution:
  1. Get Custom Setting → Found
  2. Check if enabled → YES
  3. Reset Logic:
     - 45% >= 50%? NO → Reset Notified_50_Percent__c = FALSE ✅
     - 45% >= 75%? NO → Keep Notified_75_Percent__c = FALSE
     - 45% >= 90%? NO → Keep Notified_90_Percent__c = FALSE
  4. Check 90%: NO
  5. Check 75%: NO
  6. Check 50%: NO (45% < 50%)

Result: Checkbox automatically unchecked, no email sent
```

**Step 3: PO rises to 60% consumption**
```
Consumed_Amount__c: £37,800 (60% of £63,000)
Flow Execution:
  1. Get Custom Setting → Found
  2. Check if enabled → YES
  3. Reset Logic:
     - 60% >= 50%? YES → Keep Notified_50_Percent__c (currently FALSE)
     - 60% >= 75%? NO → Reset Notified_75_Percent__c = FALSE
     - 60% >= 90%? NO → Reset Notified_90_Percent__c = FALSE
  4. Check 90%: NO
  5. Check 75%: NO
  6. Check 50%: YES (60% >= 50% AND Notified_50_Percent__c = FALSE)
  7. Send 50% email again ✅
  8. Set Notified_50_Percent__c = TRUE

Result: Email sent again (re-notification!)
```

### Key Benefits

✅ **Smart Notifications**: Only sends when crossing thresholds
✅ **Automatic Reset**: No manual intervention needed
✅ **Handles Fluctuations**: Works correctly if budget is increased/decreased
✅ **No Spam**: Doesn't send daily emails
✅ **Re-notification**: Alerts if consumption crosses threshold again

## Testing & Monitoring

### Current PO Status

**PO 00059438**:
```
Order ID: 801Sj00000OjGCUIA3
Order Number: 00059438
Status: Activated
Max Value: £63,000
Consumed Amount: £0
Consumption %: 0%
```

**Notification Status**:
- 50% Threshold: Not reached (triggers at £31,500)
- 75% Threshold: Not reached (triggers at £47,250)
- 90% Threshold: Not reached (triggers at £56,700)

### When Will Notifications Trigger?

| Threshold | Consumption Amount | Email Sent When |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 50% | £31,500 - £47,249 | First time entering this range |
| 75% | £47,250 - £56,699 | First time entering this range |
| 90% | £56,700+ | First time entering this range |

### Monitoring Queries

## Known Limitations

### 1. Repeated Reminders Mode Not Implemented

**Status**: ⚠️ Known Limitation (Documented 2025-10-14)

**Description**:
The Flow has a "Repeated Mode" decision path, but this path is currently a placeholder with no logic implemented. If `Use_Repeated_Reminders__c` is set to TRUE in the Custom Setting, the Flow will execute but take no action.

**Impact**:
- **LOW** - This mode is not being used (Custom Setting has it set to FALSE)
- Option B (one-time with reset) is the active and fully functional mode
- No impact on current production system

**Workaround**:
- Keep `Use_Repeated_Reminders__c = FALSE` in Custom Setting (current configuration)
- Use Option B reset logic which provides smarter notification behavior

**Future Enhancement**:
- Can be implemented if repeated daily reminders are actually needed
- Would require Flow modification and redeployment
- Estimated effort: 1-2 hours

**Why This is OK**:
- Option B is superior for most use cases
- Prevents notification fatigue
- Handles dynamic consumption changes intelligently
- Most organizations don't need daily repeated reminders

---

### 2. Field History Tracking Disabled

**Status**: ⚠️ Technical Limitation

**Description**:
The 6 notification fields on Order object don't have field history tracking enabled because the Order object has reached its limit of 25 tracked fields.

**Impact**:
- Cannot see historical changes to notification checkbox values
- Cannot see when notifications were marked as sent in field history

**Workaround**:
- Check Flow execution logs for audit trail
- Check email logs for confirmation of sent notifications
- Date/time fields (if Repeated Mode is ever enabled) provide timestamps

---

### 3. Email Customization Requires Deployment

**Status**: ℹ️ By Design

**Description**:
Email template content cannot be changed via Setup UI - requires metadata deployment to modify.

**Impact**:
- Changes to email wording require developer assistance
- Cannot be changed by admins in production

**Workaround**:
- Current email templates are approved by stakeholders
- Future changes can be deployed as needed

---

### 4. Single PO in Phase 1

**Status**: ℹ️ Intentional (Phase 1 Scope)

**Description**:
Only PO 00059438 is currently monitored. System supports multiple POs but stakeholders requested starting with one.

**Impact**:
- Other POs not monitored
- Need to manually add each PO to Custom Setting

**Workaround**:
- Easy to add more POs via Custom Setting (2 minutes per PO)
- No code changes required
- See Configuration Guide above

---

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2: Expand to More POs

**Effort**: Low (2 minutes per PO)
**Status**: Waiting for stakeholder confirmation

**How**:
1. Get list of POs to monitor from Kaylie Morris
2. Add each PO to Custom Setting
3. Test with one PO first
4. Roll out to others

---

### Phase 3: Admin Configuration Page (Optional)

**Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Status**: Nice to have (not required)

**What It Would Include**:
- Lightning Web Component UI
- Visual table of all monitored POs
- Add/Edit/Delete POs without navigating Setup
- Toggle notifications on/off with one click
- Built-in testing tools
- Notification history viewer

**Benefits**:
- More user-friendly for non-admins
- Faster PO management
- Better visibility

**Current Alternative**:
- Use Setup → Custom Settings (functional but less user-friendly)

---

### Phase 4: Implement Repeated Reminders Mode

**Effort**: 1-2 hours
**Status**: Not needed currently

**What It Would Do**:
- Send daily reminder emails while PO stays at/above threshold
- Use date/time fields instead of checkboxes
- Configurable reminder frequency (e.g., every 24/48 hours)

**Why It's Not Implemented**:
- Option B is better for most use cases
- Prevents email fatigue
- No stakeholder requirement for daily reminders

---

### Phase 5: Advanced Features (Future Ideas)

**Potential Enhancements**:
- Dashboard showing all PO consumption levels
- Configurable threshold percentages per PO
- Additional recipients per PO
- Slack/Teams integration
- Escalation logic (email manager if no action taken)
- Predictive analytics (estimate when PO will hit 100%)

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue 1: No Email Received When PO Reaches Threshold

**Possible Causes**:
1. PO not in Custom Setting
2. Notifications_Enabled__c = FALSE
3. Checkbox already marked (already notified)
4. Email in spam folder
5. Flow is not activated

**Troubleshooting Steps**:
```sql
-- Step 1: Check Custom Setting
SELECT Name, PO_ID__c, Notifications_Enabled__c
FROM PO_Notification_Settings__c
WHERE PO_ID__c = 'YOUR_ORDER_ID'

-- Step 2: Check Order fields
SELECT Id, OrderNumber, Consumed_Amount_Percent__c,
       Notified_50_Percent__c, Notified_75_Percent__c,
       Notified_90_Percent__c
FROM Order
WHERE Id = 'YOUR_ORDER_ID'

-- Step 3: Check Flow is active
Setup → Flows → Find flow → Verify "Active" status

-- Step 4: Check email logs
Setup → Email Log Files → Search for Order Number
```

---

#### Issue 2: Duplicate Emails Sent

**Possible Cause**:
- Option B reset logic working correctly (not a bug - it's re-notifying after consumption dropped and rose again)

**Verification**:
- Check if consumption dropped below threshold between emails
- This is expected behavior with Option B

**If Truly Duplicate**:
- Check Flow execution logs
- Verify checkbox field values
- Contact technical support

---

#### Issue 3: Flow Errors

**How to Check**:
1. Setup → Flows
2. Find: Order Consumption Multi-Threshold Notification
3. Click: View Errors

**Common Errors**:
- **Email send failed**: Check recipient email addresses valid
- **Field not found**: Verify custom fields deployed correctly
- **Custom Setting not found**: Verify record exists for PO

**Resolution**:
- Check error message for specific field/issue
- Verify all components deployed
- Contact technical support if persistent
