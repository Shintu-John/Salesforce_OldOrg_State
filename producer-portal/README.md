## Implementation History

### Issue #1: License Visibility - Login Users Cannot See Data (Oct 20, 2025)

**Problem**:
- Customer Community Plus Login license users couldn't see Producer data
- Only Customer Community Plus users could access

**Root Cause**:
- Customer_Community_Plus permission set had object permissions but no field-level access
- Login license requires explicit field permissions

**Fix Implemented**:
- Updated Customer_Community_Plus permission set
- Added field-level security for all Producer objects
- Deploy ID: 0AfSj000000z1C5KAI

**Testing**:
- Tested with Login license user
- Verified all 5 Producer objects visible
- Confirmed CRUD operations work

### Issue #2: Director Login Users Cannot See Pending Signatures (Oct 20, 2025)

**Problem**:
- Directors with Login license couldn't see records awaiting signature
- Data visibility issue for specific user group

**Root Cause**:
- Missing permission set assignments for Director users

**Fix Implemented**:
- Assigned Customer_Community_Plus permission set to all Director users
- Deploy ID: 0AfSj000000z1IXKAY

**Testing**:
- Verified Directors can see pending records
- Confirmed signature workflow functional

### Issue #3: Zero Value Tracking - Wrong Reason Field (Oct 20, 2025)

**Problem**:
- Zero values tracked using wrong reason field
- Incorrect data capture for zero submissions

**Root Cause**:
- Flow logic referenced incorrect field

**Fix Implemented**:
- Updated flow logic to use correct reason field
- Deploy ID: 0AfSj000000z1LlKAI

**Testing**:
- Tested zero value submissions
- Verified correct field populated

### Issue #4: Validation Questions Only Check One Period (Oct 21, 2025)

**Problem**:
- Variance validation only compared current quarter to previous quarter
- Didn't check same quarter from previous year
- Missed important year-over-year variances

**Root Cause**:
- ProducerPlacedOnMarketTriggerHelper only implemented one comparison logic
- Incomplete variance detection algorithm

**Fix Implemented**:
- Enhanced ProducerPlacedOnMarketTriggerHelper with multi-period comparison
- Now checks: current vs previous quarter AND current vs same quarter last year
- Deploy ID: 0AfSj000000z1NNKAY

**Testing**:
- Created test scenarios for both comparison types
- Verified validation questions created correctly

### Issue #5: Login License Users Cannot See Records - Sharing (Oct 21, 2025)

**Problem**:
- Login license users had permission set but still couldn't see records
- Object and field permissions correct, but sharing rules missing
- Manual sharing rules only worked for Customer Community Plus users

**Root Cause**:
- Salesforce standard "Manual Sharing" only applies to Customer Community Plus license
- Login license requires trigger-based or Apex sharing

**Fix Implemented**:
1. Created ProducerSharingHelper.cls - Sharing logic for all 3 Producer objects
2. Created ProducerSharingHelperTest.cls - Test coverage
3. Created 3 new triggers:
   - ProducerContractSharingTrigger.trigger
   - ProducerObligationSharingTrigger.trigger
   - ProducerPlacedOnMarketSharingTrigger.trigger
4. Created UserSharingBackfillHelper.cls - For existing records
5. Created UserSharingBackfillHelperTest.cls - Test coverage

**Deploy IDs**:
- Sharing helper classes: 0AfSj000000z35pKAA
- Sharing triggers: 0AfSj000000z3AfKAI
- Backfill helpers: 0AfSj000000z2xlKAA

**Testing**:
- Created Login license test user
- Verified access to all Producer records
- Tested sharing on insert, update, and backfill scenarios
- Confirmed 85%+ test coverage

## Business Logic

### Variance Detection

When a Producer submits quarterly tonnage data:

1. **Compare to Previous Quarter**:
   - Get previous quarter's submission for same category
   - Calculate variance percentage
   - If > threshold (e.g., 20%), flag for validation

2. **Compare to Same Quarter Last Year**:
   - Get same quarter from previous year
   - Calculate year-over-year variance
   - If > threshold, flag for validation

3. **Create Validation Questions**:
   - Auto-create Validation_Question__c record
   - Link to current submission
   - Producer must provide explanation before proceeding

### Charge Calculations

Based on tonnage submitted and pricing tiers:

- Lookup Producer_Obligation_Pricing__c records
- Match tonnage to appropriate tier
- Calculate charges per category
- Sum for total quarterly charge

### Sharing Logic

**For Customer Community Plus Users**:
- Manual sharing rules work automatically
- Users see records they're manually shared to

**For Login License Users**:
- Trigger-based sharing required
- ProducerSharingHelper creates share records
- On contract assignment, shares:
  - Producer_Contract__c
  - All related Producer_Obligation__c
  - All related Producer_Placed_on_Market__c
