# Invoice Email Portal Access Solution - OldOrg State

**Deployment Date**: October 9, 2025
**Deployed By**: John Shintu
**Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED & ACTIVE
**Org**: OldOrg (recyclinglives.my.salesforce.com)

---

## Overview

This scenario documents the invoice portal access solution that allows customers to view and download invoice PDFs through a guest-accessible web portal. The solution addresses a customer complaint where the portal page only displayed job paperwork (Delivery Notes) but not the invoice PDF itself.

### Business Problem Solved

**Customer Issue** (Andel Ltd - Phillip Parker):
- Customer received invoice email with portal link
- Portal showed only job paperwork (Delivery Note)
- Invoice PDF was NOT visible on the portal
- Customer assumed invoice wasn't sent

**Root Cause**:
The portal page ([InvoiceFileList.page](https://recyclinglives.my.salesforce.com)) was originally designed to display ONLY job paperwork files (WTN, POD, Weighbridge Tickets) which are linked to Job__c records. Invoice PDFs, which are linked to Invoice__c records via ContentDocumentLink, were never queried or displayed.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. Enhanced portal controller to fetch invoice PDF files
2. Added "Invoice Files" section to portal with download capability
3. Implemented automatic ContentDistribution creation for ALL future invoices
4. Fixed caching issues for immediate visibility

## Components Deployed

### 1. Apex Classes (Modified)

#### A. InvoiceFileListController.cls

**Object ID**: 01p4H0000097RICQA2
**Created**: May 7, 2021 by Vesium Gerry Gregoire
**Last Modified**: October 9, 2025 by John Shintu
**API Version**: 65.0

**Purpose**: Controller for the invoice portal page that displays both invoice PDFs and job paperwork.

**Modifications Made** (October 9, 2025):

1. **Added Property** (Lines 24-25):
   ```apex
   public List<InvoiceFileDetails> invoiceFileDetailsList {public get; private set;}
   ```
   - Stores list of invoice PDF files to display in portal
   - Used by Visualforce page to render "Invoice Files" section

2. **Added Invoice File Fetching Logic** (Lines 192-246):
   - Queries ContentDocumentLink for invoice PDFs
   - Implements deduplication by filename (shows most recent version only)
   - Queries existing ContentDistribution records
   - Builds invoiceFileDetailsList with download URLs
   - Guest-user compatible (uses public URLs)

3. **Added Inner Class** (Lines 311-323):
   ```apex
   public class InvoiceFileDetails {
       public String url {public get; private set;}
       public String downloadUrl {public get; private set;}
       public String fileName {public get; private set;}
       public String docType {public get; private set;}
   }
   ```

**Key Features**:
- Deduplication logic for files with same name
- Guest user access through ContentDistribution URLs
- Bulkified queries (no SOQL in loops)
- Handles missing ContentDistribution gracefully

---

#### B. ContentDistributionHelper.cls

**Object ID**: 01p8e000000CajgAAC
**Created**: June 6, 2022 by Vesium Gerry Gregoire
**Last Modified**: October 9, 2025 by John Shintu
**API Version**: 65.0

**Purpose**: Utility class for creating ContentDistribution records for both job paperwork and invoice PDFs.

**Modifications Made** (October 9, 2025):

**Added Method** (Lines 78-140):
```apex
public static void manageInvoiceContentDistribution(Set<Id> invoiceIds)
```

**What it does**:
1. Queries all PDF files linked to invoices via ContentDocumentLink
2. Checks for existing ContentDistribution records
3. Creates new ContentDistribution ONLY if they don't exist
4. Does NOT set `RelatedRecordId` (critical for guest user access)
5. Bulkified to handle 200 invoices at once

**Key Technical Decision**:
- Invoice ContentDistribution records do NOT set `RelatedRecordId` (allows guest access)
- Job paperwork ContentDistribution records DO set `RelatedRecordId` (different security model)

**Settings Applied**:
```apex
ContentDistribution cdRec = new ContentDistribution();
cdRec.ContentVersionId = versionId;
cdRec.Name = versionIdToTitle.get(versionId);
cdRec.PreferencesAllowViewInBrowser = true;
cdRec.PreferencesAllowOriginalDownload = true;
cdRec.PreferencesAllowPDFDownload = true;
cdRec.PreferencesLinkLatestVersion = false;
// RelatedRecordId is NOT set for guest user access
```

---

#### C. InvoiceTriggerHandler.cls

**Object ID**: 01p4H000009Sik3QAC
**Created**: November 23, 2021 by Vesium Gerry Gregoire
**Last Modified**: October 9, 2025 by John Shintu
**API Version**: 65.0

**Purpose**: Trigger handler for Invoice__c object that manages invoice lifecycle events.

**Modifications Made** (October 9, 2025):

**Added to afterInsert()** (Line 6):
```apex
ContentDistributionHelper.manageInvoiceContentDistribution(invoiceRecsMap.keySet());
```

**Added to afterUpdate()** (Line 30):
```apex
ContentDistributionHelper.manageInvoiceContentDistribution(invoiceRecsMap.keySet());
```

**When This Executes**:
- After invoice insert (new invoices)
- After invoice update (when PDFs are attached later by email flow)
- Automatically creates ContentDistribution for ALL invoice PDFs
- No manual intervention needed

---

### 2. Visualforce Pages (Modified)

#### InvoiceFileList.page

**Object ID**: 0664H000003MDDOQA4
**Created**: May 7, 2021 by Vesium Gerry Gregoire
**Last Modified**: October 9, 2025 by John Shintu
**API Version**: 65.0

**Purpose**: Guest-accessible portal page that displays invoice PDFs and job paperwork for customers.

**Public URL Pattern**:
```
https://recyclinglives.my.salesforce-sites.com/invoicefiledetails?invoiceid=[Invoice_Id]
```

**Modifications Made** (October 9, 2025):

1. **Added cache="false"** (Line 2):
   ```xml
   <apex:page cache="false" id="InvoiceFileList" showHeader="false"
              controller="InvoiceFileListController">
   ```
   - Prevents 24-hour Salesforce page caching
   - Ensures updates are immediately visible

2. **Added "Invoice Files" Section** (Lines 30-38):
   ```xml
   <apex:pageBlockSection title="Invoice Files" columns="1" collapsible="false"
                           rendered="{!invoiceFileDetailsList.size > 0}">
       <apex:pageBlockSectionItem>
           <apex:pageBlockTable value="{!invoiceFileDetailsList}" var="invoiceFile"
                                id="invoiceTable" rowClasses="odd,even" styleClass="tableClass">
               <apex:column value="{!invoiceFile.fileName}" headerValue="File Name" />
               <apex:column value="{!invoiceFile.docType}" headerValue="Document Type" />
               <apex:column headerValue="Action">
                   <apex:commandButton value="Download"
                                       onclick="window.open('{!invoiceFile.url}');return false;"/>
               </apex:column>
           </apex:pageBlockTable>
       </apex:pageBlockSectionItem>
   </apex:pageBlockSection>
   ```

3. **Removed Empty "Invoice" Section**:
   - Previous section showed nothing (guest user couldn't read Invoice__c.Name)
   - Removed to reduce confusion

**Guest User Access**:
- Uses ContentDistribution public URLs (no authentication required)
- Download button uses `{!invoiceFile.url}` which points to DistributionPublicUrl
- Guest user profile has access to page and controller

## Architecture & Data Flow

### Invoice Email Flow → Portal Access

```
1. Invoice Created
   └─> Invoice__c record inserted

2. Email Flow Triggered
   └─> Invoice_Action_Send_Invoice flow runs

3. PDF Generated
   └─> Opero Documents creates invoice PDF

4. PDF Attached to Invoice
   └─> ContentDocumentLink created (links PDF to Invoice__c)

5. Invoice Trigger Fires
   └─> InvoiceTriggerHandler.afterUpdate() executes
       └─> ContentDistributionHelper.manageInvoiceContentDistribution() called

6. ContentDistribution Created
   └─> Public URL generated for invoice PDF
       └─> DistributionPublicUrl: https://recyclinglives.my.content.force.com/...

7. Customer Receives Email
   └─> Email contains:
       - Invoice PDF attachment
       - Portal link: https://recyclinglives.my.salesforce-sites.com/invoicefiledetails?invoiceid=XXX

8. Customer Clicks Portal Link
   └─> InvoiceFileList.page loads
       └─> InvoiceFileListController fetches:
           - Invoice PDFs (from ContentDocumentLink)
           - Job Paperwork (from Job__c fields)
       └─> Page displays:
           - "Invoice Files" section with download button
           - "Job Paperwork" section with delivery notes
```

## Configuration Details

### Guest User Profile Requirements

**Profile Name**: "Invoice File Details Profile"
**User License**: Guest User License

**Required Permissions**:
- Read access to ContentDistribution
- Read access to ContentDocumentLink
- Read access to Invoice__c object (limited)
- ActivitiesAccess permission
- ContentWorkspaces permission
- UseWebLink permission

**Apex Class Access**:
- InvoiceFileListController

**Visualforce Page Access**:
- InvoiceFileList

---

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. ContentDistribution Without RelatedRecordId

**Decision**: Invoice ContentDistribution records do NOT set `RelatedRecordId`

**Reason**:
- Setting `RelatedRecordId` requires user authentication
- Guest users cannot authenticate
- Not setting it allows public access via DistributionPublicUrl

**Trade-off**:
- Invoice ContentDistribution records are NOT linked back to Invoice__c
- Cannot query ContentDistribution by Invoice ID (must go through ContentVersionId)

---

### 2. Deduplication by Filename

**Decision**: Show only most recent file when multiple versions exist with same name

**Implementation**:
```apex
Set<String> seenFileNames = new Set<String>();
for (ContentDocumentLink cdl : invoiceDocLinks) {
    String fileName = cdl.ContentDocument.Title + '.' + cdl.ContentDocument.FileExtension;
    if (!seenFileNames.contains(fileName)) {
        seenFileNames.add(fileName);
        // Add to display list
    }
}
```

**Reason**:
- Invoices may be regenerated and re-uploaded with same filename
- Customers should see only the latest version
- Prevents confusion from multiple "Invoice - INV-000177160.pdf" entries

---

### 3. Cache Prevention

**Decision**: Set `cache="false"` on Visualforce page

**Reason**:
- Salesforce caches Visualforce pages for 24 hours by default
- After deployment, customers saw old page without "Invoice Files" section
- cache="false" ensures changes are immediately visible

**Trade-off**:
- Slightly slower page load (no browser cache)
- Acceptable trade-off for correctness

---

### 4. Automatic Trigger vs Manual Creation

**Decision**: Automatically create ContentDistribution via Invoice trigger

**Reason**:
- New invoices need ContentDistribution for portal access
- Manual creation would be error-prone
- Trigger fires AFTER PDF attachment (via email flow update)

**Alternative Considered**:
- Create on-demand when customer accesses portal
- Rejected: Would require portal page to perform DML (not allowed for guest user)

---

- Version 1: Oct 1, 2025 (136,864 bytes)
- Version 2: Oct 9, 2025 (136,836 bytes)

**Expected**: Show only most recent version (Oct 9)

**Result**: ✅ PASS
- Only 1 file displayed
- Most recent version shown

---

#### Test 3: Automatic ContentDistribution Creation ✅

**Action**: Update invoice record via Apex

**Expected**: Trigger creates ContentDistribution records

**Result**: ✅ PASS
- Trigger fired successfully
- Checked for duplicates (none created if already exists)
- New invoices automatically get ContentDistribution

**Expected**: Handle multiple invoices efficiently

**Result**: ✅ PASS
- Bulkified SOQL queries
- No governor limit issues
- Can handle 200 invoices at once

---

## Known Limitations

### 1. Guest User Permissions ⚠️

**Limitation**: ContentDistribution with `RelatedRecordId` set requires authentication

**Workaround**: We explicitly set `RelatedRecordId = null` for invoice PDFs

**Impact**: Invoice ContentDistribution records are NOT linked back to Invoice record

---

### 2. No Invoice Number Display in Portal ⚠️

**Limitation**: Guest users don't have field-level security on `Invoice__c.Name`

**Workaround**: Removed the "Invoice" section (was showing empty label)

**Impact**: Portal doesn't display invoice number (customer already knows it from email)

---

### 3. Manual ContentDistribution for Pre-Oct 9 Invoices ⚠️

**Limitation**: Invoices created before October 9, 2025 don't have ContentDistribution records

**Options**:
- Option A: Manually update each invoice to trigger creation
- Option B: Run batch Apex to create for all old invoices
- Option C: Create on-demand when customer accesses portal (future enhancement)

**Impact**: Old invoices won't show "Invoice Files" section until ContentDistribution is created

---

### 4. Portal Shows One Invoice at a Time ⚠️

**Limitation**: Portal URL takes ONE invoice ID, shows files for that invoice only

**Workaround**: Email contains separate portal link for each invoice

**Impact**: Cannot show multiple invoices on one page
