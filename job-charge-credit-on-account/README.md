## Overview

This scenario documents a bug fix for the "Job Charge Minimum 20% Gross on Rebate" flow that was incorrectly executing on "Credit on Account" charges and overwriting user-entered Cost values.

### Business Problem Solved

**Reported By**: Louise Painter
**Date Reported**: October 22, 2025

**Issue**: When users created "Credit on Account" Job Charges with correct negative Cost and Sales Price values, upon clicking Save, the Cost__c value was being automatically changed (overwri tten from negative to positive) by a flow that should only run on Rebate charges.

**Impact**:
- 3 out of 279 Credit on Account charges created since Jan 15, 2025 were affected (1.08%)
- Cost values were incorrect, causing accounting discrepancies
- Users had to manually correct values after save

**Root Cause**: Flow entry criteria included "Credit on Account" charges in an OR condition with "Rebate" charges, causing the flow to execute on both types when it should only run on Rebates.

---

## Components Modified

### 1. Flow: Job_Charge_Minimum_20_Gross_on_Rebate

**API Name**: Job_Charge_Minimum_20_Gross_on_Rebate
**Type**: Record-Triggered Flow
**Trigger**: Before Save
**Object**: Job_Charge__c

**Purpose**: Enforce a minimum 20% gross margin on Rebate charges by auto-adjusting Cost__c and Job Sales_Price__c if the margin is too low.

**Modifications Made** (October 22, 2025):

**Change 1 - Removed "Credit on Account" from Entry Criteria**:

Before (v5):
```xml
<filterLogic>1 AND (2 OR 3) AND 4 AND 5 AND 6</filterLogic>
<filters>
    <field>Charge_Type__c</field>
    <operator>EqualTo</operator>
    <value>
        <stringValue>Rebate</stringValue>
    </value>
</filters>
<filters>
    <field>Charge_Type__c</field>
    <operator>EqualTo</operator>
    <value>
        <stringValue>Credit on Account</stringValue>  ← REMOVED
    </value>
</filters>
```

After (v6):
```xml
<filterLogic>1 AND 2 AND 3 AND 4 AND 5</filterLogic>
<filters>
    <field>Charge_Type__c</field>
    <operator>EqualTo</operator>
    <value>
        <stringValue>Rebate</stringValue>
    </value>
</filters>
<!-- Credit on Account filter completely removed -->
```

**Change 2 - Updated Flow Description**:
```xml
<description>22/10/2025: Removed Credit on Account from filter - should only run on Rebate charges
15/01/2025: Bypassed for BT, BG and JLP</description>
```

**Versions**:
- **v6** (Active) - October 22, 2025 - Fix deployed
- **v5** (Obsolete) - Had the bug
- **v4** and earlier - Prior versions

**File Location**: `force-app/main/default/flows/Job_Charge_Minimum_20_Gross_on_Rebate.flow-meta.xml`

## Technical Background

### Understanding Job Charge Field Structure

⚠️ **CRITICAL CONCEPT**: Job Charges have TWO sets of Cost/Sales Price fields:

1. **Database Fields**: `Cost__c` and `Sales_Price__c`
   - Actual stored values
   - Maintain accounting consistency

2. **Formula Display Fields**: `Cost_Rebate__c` and `Sales_Price_Rebate__c`
   - What users see in the UI
   - Labeled as "Cost." and "Sales Price."
   - For Rebate charges, these formulas SWAP the display

**Why the Swap?**
- For Rebate charges, money flows in reverse:
  - Supplier pays us (money in)
  - We pay customer (money out)
- Database maintains standard accounting: Cost = money out, Sales Price = money in
- Formula fields swap display for Rebates to match user mental model

**Result**: What users enter in UI (using formula fields) gets stored swapped in database fields for Rebate-related charges.

### Example: The Bug in Action

**Job**: Job-000609890 ([Link](https://recyclinglives.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/Job__c/a26Sj000001xRRqIAM/view))

**Related Rebate Charge (Database)**:
- `Cost__c` = 318.98
- `Sales_Price__c` = 396.78

**Related Rebate Charge (UI Display via Formulas)**:
- Cost (`Cost_Rebate__c`) = £396.78 (displays `Sales_Price__c` for Rebates)
- Sales Price (`Sales_Price_Rebate__c`) = £318.98 (displays `Cost__c` for Rebates)

**User Creates Credit on Account (Entered in UI)**:
- Cost = -£396.78 ✓ (correct - negative of displayed Rebate Cost)
- Sales Price = -£318.98 ✓ (correct - negative of displayed Rebate Sales Price)

**What Should Be Stored (Swapped from UI)**:
- `Cost__c` = -396.78 (negative of Rebate's `Sales_Price__c`)
- `Sales_Price__c` = -318.98 (negative of Rebate's `Cost__c`)

**What Actually Happened (BUG)**:
- `Cost__c` = **318.98** ✗ (flow overwrote it - became positive!)
- `Sales_Price__c` = -318.98 ✓ (stayed correct)

**After Fix**:
- `Cost__c` = **-396.78** ✓ (corrected)
- `Sales_Price__c` = **-318.98** ✓ (correct)

## Flow Logic and Entry Conditions

### When the Flow Executes

The flow only executes when **ALL** these conditions are met:

1. ✅ `CreatedDate` > January 15, 2025
2. ✅ `Charge_Type__c` = "Rebate" (after fix - was "Rebate" OR "Credit on Account")
3. ✅ Vendor Account NOT in excluded list (BT, BG, JLP)
4. ✅ `Sales_Account__r.Account_Uses_Ratecard__c` = false
5. ✅ **Job Margin < 20%** ← KEY CONDITION
6. ✅ `Don_t_Apply_Auto_Margin__c` = false
7. ✅ `Vendor_Account__r.Don_t_Apply_Rebate_Margin__c` = false

### Why the Bug Was Rare (1.08% of charges affected)

**Statistics since January 15, 2025**:
- Total Credit on Account charges created: **279**
- Charges affected by the bug: **3 (1.08%)**
- Charges that worked correctly: **276 (98.92%)**

**Most charges avoided the bug because**:
1. Most Jobs naturally have 20% margin or higher (standard pricing)
2. Only Jobs with margin < 20% triggered the flow
3. The combination of ALL 7 conditions being met was very rare

### What the Flow Did When It Executed

When the flow incorrectly executed on Credit on Account charges:

1. **Calculated**: `Remove_20p_Margin_Full_Weight = ROUND(Job.Supplier_Price * 0.8, 0) * Job.Weight`
2. **For Job-000609890**: ROUND(51 * 0.8, 0) * 7.78 = 41 * 7.78 = **318.98**
3. **OVERWROTE**: User's `Cost__c` value (-396.78) with calculated value (318.98)
4. **Also Updated**: Parent Job's `Sales_Price__c` (not the Job Charge)

## Affected Records

### Records Fixed After Deployment

**3 Credit on Account charges were identified and manually corrected**:

1. **Job-000609890** - Job Charge ID: [ID from doc]
   - Before: Cost__c = 318.98 (wrong)
   - After: Cost__c = -396.78 (correct)

2. **Job-000605857** - Job Charge ID: [ID from doc]
   - Before: Cost__c = [wrong value]
   - After: Cost__c = [correct value]

3. **Job-000602839** - Job Charge ID: [ID from doc]
   - Before: Cost__c = [wrong value]
   - After: Cost__c = [correct value]

**Verification Query** (used to find affected records):
```sql
SELECT Id, Name, Job__r.Name, Charge_Type__c, Cost__c, Sales_Price__c,
       CreatedDate, Job__r.Margin__c
FROM Job_Charge__c
WHERE Charge_Type__c = 'Credit on Account'
AND CreatedDate >= 2025-01-15T00:00:00Z
AND Job__r.Margin__c < 20
ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC
```

## Testing Results

### Test Scenarios

**Test 1: New Credit on Account with Low Margin Job** ✅

- **Setup**: Create Job with 19% margin
- **Action**: Create Credit on Account charge with negative values
- **Expected**: Cost__c preserves user-entered negative value
- **Result**: ✅ PASS - Values preserved correctly

**Test 2: New Rebate with Low Margin Job** ✅

- **Setup**: Create Job with 19% margin
- **Action**: Create Rebate charge
- **Expected**: Flow DOES execute, adjusts Cost__c to enforce 20% margin
- **Result**: ✅ PASS - Flow executes as designed for Rebates

**Test 3: Credit on Account with High Margin Job** ✅

- **Setup**: Create Job with 25% margin
- **Action**: Create Credit on Account charge
- **Expected**: Flow does NOT execute (margin already > 20%)
- **Result**: ✅ PASS - Flow correctly skipped

## Deployment History

### Deployment Details

- **Deployment Date**: October 22, 2025 at 11:18 UTC
- **Deployed By**: John Shintu
- **Flow Version**: v6 (activated)
- **Previous Version**: v5 (now obsolete)
- **Backup Location**: `/home/john/Projects/Salesforce/Backup/2025-10-22_job_charge_credit_on_account_fix/`

### Changes Summary

| Component | Change Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| Job_Charge_Minimum_20_Gross_on_Rebate | Flow Modification | Removed "Credit on Account" from entry criteria filter logic |

## Known Limitations

### 1. Historical Data Not Auto-Corrected ⚠️

**Limitation**: The fix does not automatically correct the 3 historical records affected before October 22, 2025.

**Resolution**: Manual correction was performed for all 3 identified records after deployment.

**Impact**: No outstanding incorrect records exist.

---

### 2. Flow Still Modifies Rebate Charges (As Designed) ✓

**Behavior**: The flow continues to execute on Rebate charges with < 20% margin and automatically adjusts Cost__c.

**Status**: This is INTENDED behavior, not a bug.

**Purpose**: Enforce business rule that Rebate charges must maintain minimum 20% gross margin.
