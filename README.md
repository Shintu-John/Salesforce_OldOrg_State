## How to Use This Repository

### For Migration Planning

1. **Review scenario README**: Understand what's currently deployed in OldOrg
2. **Check code folder**: See actual deployed code
3. **Verify versions**: Confirm active flow versions, trigger statuses
4. **Understand dependencies**: Review integration points and related scenarios

### For Gap Analysis

1. Compare OldOrg state (this repo) with NewOrg current state
2. Identify missing components
3. Identify version mismatches
4. Plan migration order based on dependencies

### For Reference

1. **Historical lookup**: "How did we implement X in OldOrg?"
2. **Configuration reference**: "What were the custom setting values?"
3. **Business logic**: "Why was this built this way?"

---

## Verification Methodology

All documented scenarios include verification data showing:

- **Deployment IDs**: Proof of what was deployed and when
- **Active Versions**: Flow versions, trigger statuses
- **Test Results**: Test coverage, passing tests
- **Last Modified Dates**: Timestamps of last changes
- **Modified By**: Who made the changes

### Example Verification Queries

**Check Apex Class Version:**
```bash
sf data query --query "SELECT Name, LastModifiedDate, LastModifiedBy.Name FROM ApexClass WHERE Name = 'ClassName'" --target-org OldOrg --use-tooling-api
```

**Check Trigger Status:**
```bash
sf data query --query "SELECT Name, Status FROM ApexTrigger WHERE Name = 'TriggerName'" --target-org OldOrg --use-tooling-api
```

**Check Flow Versions:**
```bash
sf data query --query "SELECT DefinitionId, VersionNumber, Status FROM Flow WHERE Definition.DeveloperName = 'FlowName' ORDER BY VersionNumber" --target-org OldOrg --use-tooling-api
```

## Contributing

### Adding New Scenarios

When documenting a new scenario:

1. **Create scenario folder**: `mkdir scenario-name`
2. **Create README.md**: Document current state using standard structure
3. **Create code folder**: `mkdir scenario-name/code`
4. **Retrieve code from OldOrg**: Use `sf project retrieve start` commands
5. **Copy code files**: Place in appropriate subfolders (classes/, triggers/, etc.)
6. **Verify current state**: Run queries to confirm active versions
7. **Update master README**: Add scenario to table above

### Documentation Best Practices

- ✅ Be comprehensive: Include ALL details
- ✅ Show verification: Include query results
- ✅ Explain WHY: Not just WHAT, but WHY it was built this way
- ✅ Link related scenarios: Cross-reference dependencies
- ✅ Include timestamps: When was this verified?
- ✅ Show version history: How did this evolve over time?
