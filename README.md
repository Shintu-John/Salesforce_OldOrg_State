## Fresh Start - Enhanced Workflow (Oct 22, 2025)

### Why Fresh Start?

Previous documentation lacked critical verification steps:
- ‚ùå No line-by-line code content verification
- ‚ùå Incomplete dependency analysis from actual code
- ‚ùå Missing CLI vs Manual UI deployment step distinction
- ‚ùå Inconsistent file naming conventions

### Enhanced Workflow Now Includes

‚úÖ **Step 3b: Code Dependency Analysis**
- Read actual Apex classes to find SOQL queries (extract fields/objects)
- Find Custom Settings accessed
- Find Queues, Record Types, Custom Labels referenced
- Read Flow metadata for dependencies
- Create complete dependency list with line numbers

‚úÖ **Step 3c: Implementation Verification (CRITICAL)**
- Date verification: Compare LastModifiedDate with documented deployment date
- Line-by-line code verification: Use sed, grep to find documented code snippets
- Logic flow verification: Verify trigger‚Üímethod‚Üífield flow
- Functional verification: Query data to prove feature works in OldOrg
- Dependency verification: Query for all dependencies
- **STOP and ASK USER if any verification fails**

‚úÖ **Professional Documentation Standards**
- ALWAYS use README.md (never DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md)
- No AI references in commits or documentation
- Working cross-repo GitHub links
- Clear marking of CLI vs Manual UI steps

## How to Use This Repository

### For Migration Planning

1. **Review scenario README**: Understand what's currently deployed in OldOrg
2. **Check source-docs folder**: See original documentation (archived)
3. **Check code folder**: See actual deployed code (verified)
4. **Verify versions**: Confirm active flow versions, trigger statuses
5. **Understand dependencies**: Review integration points and related scenarios

### For Gap Analysis

1. Compare OldOrg state (this repo) with NewOrg current state
2. Identify missing components
3. Identify version mismatches
4. Plan migration order based on dependencies

### For Reference

1. **Historical lookup**: "How did we implement X in OldOrg?"
2. **Configuration reference**: "What were the custom setting values?"
3. **Business logic**: "Why was this built this way?"
4. **Code verification**: "Does the deployed code match the documentation?"

## Verification Methodology

All documented scenarios include verification data showing:

- **Deployment IDs**: Proof of what was deployed and when
- **Active Versions**: Flow versions, trigger statuses
- **Code Content**: Line-by-line verification using sed/grep
- **Test Results**: Test coverage, passing tests
- **Last Modified Dates**: Timestamps of last changes
- **Modified By**: Who made the changes
- **Functional Proof**: Query results showing feature works

### Example Code Verification

**Verify documented code exists:**
```bash
# Read the actual retrieved code
cat force-app/main/default/classes/ClassName.cls

# Check specific line numbers mentioned in docs
sed -n '45p' force-app/main/default/classes/ClassName.cls
sed -n '78p' force-app/main/default/classes/ClassName.cls

# Search for documented code snippets
grep -n "List<CustomObject__c> records" force-app/main/default/classes/ClassName.cls
grep -n "HelperClass.helperMethod" force-app/main/default/classes/ClassName.cls

# If NOT FOUND ‚Üí STOP and ASK USER
```
