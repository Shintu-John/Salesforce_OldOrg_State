## Executive Summary

### Issue Overview

**Problem**: ALL "Pricing Information Added" email notifications stopped working September 24, 2025
**Duration**: 21 days of complete email failure
**Impact**: 205+ quotes affected, 0 emails delivered
**Affected Users**: All sales representatives (~10 users)

### Root Cause

1. **Primary**: Org-wide email address `no-reply@recyclinglives-services.com` was accidentally deleted
2. **Secondary**: Original address had `Purpose="UserSelection"` which blocks dynamic recipients

### Resolution Applied (Oct 15-16, 2025)

✅ **Configuration Changes Only** (no code deployment):
1. All 4 workflow email alerts updated to use `customerservice@recyclinglives-services.com`
2. Changes made manually via Salesforce UI
3. Later recreated `no-reply@` with correct Purpose setting
4. Reverted alerts back to `no-reply@` sender

**Resolution Method**: Setup → Process Automation → Workflow Actions → Email Alerts → Edit

## Technical Details

### Affected Workflow Email Alerts (4 total)

|------------|--------------|----------------|--------|
| Notification_to_account_owner_pricing_added | Quote_Process_1 Flow | Dynamic (accountOwner) | ❌ Completely broken |
| Notification_to_opportunity_owner_pricing_added | Quote_Process_1 Flow | Dynamic (opportunityOwner) | ❌ Completely broken |
| Email_Trigger_If_Job_Aamended_and_is_a_LMJ | LMJ_Email_Alert Flow | Hardcoded emails | ⚠️ Would work after recreation |

### Org-Wide Email Address Configuration

**Problem Configuration** (caused failure):
```
Email: no-reply@recyclinglives-services.com
Purpose: UserSelection
IsAllowAllProfiles: false
AllowedProfiles: 6 profiles
```

**Issue**: `Purpose="UserSelection"` cannot send to dynamic recipients (accountOwner, userLookup fields)

**Working Configuration** (Oct 16):
```
Email: no-reply@recyclinglives-services.com
Purpose: UserSelectionAndDefaultNoReply  (NOT POSSIBLE - only 1 allowed)
OR
Purpose: UserSelection
IsAllowAllProfiles: true  (All Profiles allowed)
AllowedProfiles: Recommended 6 profiles covering 99.9% usage
```

### Recommended Profile Access

**For no-reply@ org-wide address** (99.9% coverage):

1. 1.0 Supply Chain (85.7% of triggers)
2. 1.0 Supply Chain Manager (10.2%)
3. 2.0 Customer Service (1.7%)
4. 2.0 Commercial Sales (1.2%)
5. 2.0 Internal Sales (0.5%)

## Resolution Steps Applied

### Step 1: Temporary Fix (Oct 15, 2025)

**Action**: Changed email alerts to use `customerservice@recyclinglives-services.com`

**Why This Worked**:
- `customerservice@` has `Purpose="UserSelectionAndDefaultNoReply"`
- This Purpose supports dynamic recipients
- Change made via UI (no deployment needed)

**How**:
1. Setup → Process Automation → Workflow Actions → Email Alerts
2. Edit each of 4 alerts
3. Change "From Email Address" from `no-reply@` to `customerservice@`
4. Save

### Step 2: Permanent Fix (Oct 16, 2025)

**Action**: Recreated `no-reply@` org-wide address with proper settings

**Configuration**:
1. Setup → Organization-Wide Addresses → New
2. Email: `no-reply@recyclinglives-services.com`
3. Display Name: "Recycling Lives No-Reply"
4. Allow All Profiles: ☑ (checked) - for testing
5. Verify email address (click link in verification email)

**Revert Email Alerts**:
1. Edit all 4 workflow email alerts
2. Change "From Email Address" back to `no-reply@`
3. Save each alert

**Test**:
- Triggered pricing workflow
- Email successfully delivered to Katie Alexander
- Verified in Katie's mailbox (checked "Loss making jobs - to do" folder)

### Step 3: Apply Profile Restrictions (Recommended)

**Action**: Restrict `no-reply@` to 6 specific profiles

**Why**: Prevent spam, limit to actual workflow users

**How**:
1. Setup → Organization-Wide Addresses
2. Edit `no-reply@recyclinglives-services.com`
3. Uncheck "Allow All Profiles"
4. Select only 6 profiles listed above
5. Save

## Lessons Learned

### Configuration Issues

1. **Org-Wide Address Deletion**: Can happen during troubleshooting, causes silent failures
2. **Purpose Limitations**: `UserSelection` blocks dynamic recipients (not obvious)
3. **Silent Failures**: Workflow email alerts create tasks even when email fails
4. **Misleading Task Subjects**: "Supplier pricing email sent" created even when no email sent

### Testing Challenges

1. **False Positives**: Task creation doesn't mean email delivered
2. **No EmailMessage Records**: Workflow alerts don't log to EmailMessage
3. **Manual Verification Required**: Must check actual recipient inboxes
4. **Mailbox Rules**: Can hide successfully delivered emails (Katie's case)

### Troubleshooting Improvements

1. **Check Org-Wide Addresses First**: Common failure point
2. **Verify Email Delivery**: Don't rely on task creation alone
3. **Test with Multiple Recipients**: Ensure all recipient types work
4. **Check Mailbox Rules**: Auto-filing can hide delivered emails

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. ✅ Keep `no-reply@` with 6 profile access (Done Oct 16)
2. ✅ Monitor email delivery for 1 week post-fix
3. ✅ Document configuration in runbook

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Add Email Monitoring**: Alert if no pricing emails sent for 24 hours
2. **Update Task Subjects**: Change "email sent" to "pricing notification triggered"
3. **Create Test Suite**: Automated tests for email delivery
4. **Document Org-Wide Addresses**: Maintain list of all addresses and their purposes

### Configuration Documentation

**Create runbook entry**:
- Which org-wide addresses exist
- What each address is used for
- Which Purpose setting each has
- Why specific settings were chosen
- How to test email delivery
