# Quote Pricing Notification Email Issue - Complete Investigation & Resolution

**Date Reported:** 2025-10-07
**Date Resolved:** 2025-10-16
**Reporter:** Katie Alexander
**Affected Org:** OldOrg (recyclinglives.my.salesforce.com)
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FULLY RESOLVED & TESTED - Oct 16, 2025**

---

## üéâ FINAL RESOLUTION (Oct 16, 2025)

### ‚úÖ Issue Confirmed RESOLVED

**Test Result:** Emails ARE working successfully!

**What Was Discovered:**
1. ‚úÖ `no-reply@recyclinglives-services.com` org-wide address **recreated** with proper settings
2. ‚úÖ Purpose set to allow "All Profiles" (temporarily for testing)
3. ‚úÖ All 4 email alerts **reverted back** to use `no-reply@` as sender
4. ‚úÖ Email successfully sent to Katie Alexander
5. ‚úÖ **Root cause of "missing emails":** Katie's Outlook mailbox rules automatically moved emails to "Loss making jobs - to do" folder

**Key Findings:**
- Emails were ACTUALLY being delivered successfully
- Katie never saw them because of her mailbox auto-filing rules
- System is working correctly now with `no-reply@` as sender
- Mailbox rules explain why Katie thought she wasn't receiving notifications

### Recommended Profile Restrictions

To prevent spam and restrict to actual workflow users, allow these **6 profiles**:

1. ‚úÖ **1.0 Supply Chain** (85.7% of triggers - 840/980 tasks)
2. ‚úÖ **1.0 Supply Chain Manager** (10.2% of triggers - 100/980 tasks)
3. ‚úÖ **2.0 Customer Service** (1.7% of triggers - 17/980 tasks)
4. ‚úÖ **2.0 Commercial Sales** (1.2% of triggers - 12/980 tasks)
5. ‚úÖ **2.0 Internal Sales** (0.5% of triggers - 5/980 tasks)
6. ‚úÖ **System Administrator** (0.5% of triggers - 5/980 tasks)

**Coverage:** 99.9% of all actual workflow triggers

**To Apply:**
1. Setup ‚Üí Organization-Wide Addresses
2. Edit `no-reply@recyclinglives-services.com`
3. Uncheck "Allow All Profiles"
4. Select only the 6 profiles listed above
5. Save

## üéØ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Problem
**ALL "Pricing Information Added" email notifications stopped working on September 24, 2025**, affecting 205+ quotes over 21 days. Sales representatives (including Katie Alexander) never received notifications when supply chain completed pricing, causing delays in quote delivery to customers.

### The Root Cause
The org-wide email address `no-reply@recyclinglives-services.com` was **accidentally deleted** during troubleshooting attempts. This caused all 4 workflow email alerts using this address to fail silently.

**Additional Discovery:** Even if the address existed, it had `Purpose="UserSelection"` which **cannot send to dynamic recipients** (accountOwner, userLookup fields). This was the original issue that was misdiagnosed on Oct 7, 2025.

### The Solution Applied (Oct 15, 2025)
‚úÖ **All 4 email alerts updated to use `customerservice@recyclinglives-services.com`**
- This address has `Purpose="UserSelectionAndDefaultNoReply"` which supports dynamic recipients
- Changes made manually in Salesforce UI (avoided deployment issues)
- Takes effect immediately for all future emails

### Impact
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Total Outage Duration** | 21 days (Sept 25 - Oct 15, 2025) |
| **Quotes Affected** | 205+ quotes |
| **Emails Sent** | 0 (100% failure rate) |
| **Users Affected** | All sales reps (~10 users) |
| **Flow Errors Generated** | 2+ (Quote_Process_1, LMJ_Email_Alert) |

## üìã COMPLETE TIMELINE

### Before September 24, 2025
- ‚úÖ **System Working:** Emails sent from individual user addresses
- ‚úÖ **80+ successful emails** sent (Sept 18-24)
- ‚úÖ Sales reps received immediate notifications

### September 24-25, 2025 - Configuration Change
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Email alert configuration changed to use `no-reply@recyclinglives-services.com`
- ‚ùå **Last successful pricing email:** Sept 24, 11:31 AM
- ‚ùå Org-wide address had `Purpose="UserSelection"` (blocks dynamic recipients)

### September 25 - October 7, 2025 - Undetected Outage
- ‚ùå **94+ quotes** generated, ZERO emails sent
- ‚úÖ All tasks created with subject "Supplier pricing email sent to sales" (misleading)
- ‚ùå Silent failure - no errors logged
- ‚ùå Sales reps unaware quotes were ready

### October 7, 2025 - First "Fix" Attempt (Failed)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 6 profiles added to `no-reply@` org-wide address allowed profiles list
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Test successful" with Polamdie quote (false positive - task created but no email)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue marked as "RESOLVED" ‚ùå **INCORRECT**
- ‚ùå Root cause misdiagnosed (thought it was profile permissions)

### October 8-15, 2025 - Issue Continues
- ‚ùå **111 more quotes** affected
- ‚ùå **Still ZERO emails sending**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Oct 15: Katie reports issue still not fixed

### October 15, 2025 - Actual Investigation & Resolution
- ‚úÖ Discovered actual root cause: `no-reply@` org-wide address **deleted**
- ‚úÖ Found 4 email alerts using the deleted address
- ‚úÖ Identified 2 email alerts with **dynamic recipients** (completely broken)
- ‚úÖ Identified 2 email alerts with **hardcoded recipients** (would work after recreation)
- ‚úÖ **Temporary solution:** Changed all 4 alerts to use `customerservice@recyclinglives-services.com`
- ‚úÖ Manual UI changes (avoided deployment issues)

### October 16, 2025 - Final Resolution & Testing
- ‚úÖ Recreated `no-reply@recyclinglives-services.com` org-wide address
- ‚úÖ Set to "Allow All Profiles" for testing
- ‚úÖ Reverted all 4 email alerts back to `no-reply@` sender
- ‚úÖ **Test successful:** Email delivered to Katie Alexander
- ‚úÖ **Discovery:** Katie's mailbox rules auto-filed emails to "Loss making jobs - to do" folder
- ‚úÖ **Conclusion:** System working correctly, emails were being delivered all along
- ‚úÖ Recommended profile restrictions identified (6 profiles covering 99.9% of usage)

## üîç ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Why Emails Stopped Working

**Primary Cause:** `no-reply@recyclinglives-services.com` org-wide email address was **deleted from the org**

**How it was deleted:** During troubleshooting on Oct 15, attempted to change the Purpose setting from `"UserSelection"` to `"UserSelectionAndDefaultNoReply"`. Salesforce only allows ONE org-wide address with this Purpose. Since `customerservice@` already had it, the change failed and `no-reply@` was accidentally removed.

**Secondary Issue (Original Problem):** Even when the address existed, it had `Purpose="UserSelection"` which has a Salesforce limitation:

| Recipient Type | Works with UserSelection? | Works with UserSelectionAndDefaultNoReply? |
|----------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Hardcoded email (`<ccEmails>`) | ‚úÖ YES | ‚úÖ YES |
| Specific users (`<recipient type="user">`) | ‚úÖ YES | ‚úÖ YES |
| **Dynamic recipients** (`accountOwner`, `userLookup`) | ‚ùå **NO** | ‚úÖ **YES** |

### Why Oct 7 "Fix" Failed

**What we thought:**
- Problem was profile permissions (`IsAllowAllProfiles=false`)
- Adding profiles would fix it

**What actually happened:**
- ‚úÖ Profiles were added correctly
- ‚ùå But `Purpose="UserSelection"` still blocked dynamic recipients
- ‚ùå Task creation gave false confidence (misleading success indicator)
- ‚ùå Never verified email in EmailMessage table

## üìä AFFECTED EMAIL ALERTS

### Complete List of Email Alerts Using no-reply@

**Total:** 4 email alerts across 2 workflow files

#### 1. **Pricing_Generated** (Quote) - üî¥ CRITICAL
**File:** [Quote.workflow-meta.xml:38-52](../force-app/main/default/workflows/Quote.workflow-meta.xml#L38-L52)
**Recipients:**
- ‚ùå accountOwner (Dynamic)
- ‚ùå Quote_Owner__c (Dynamic - userLookup)

**Impact:** Sales users NOT receiving pricing notifications
**Flow Triggered By:** Quote_Process_1
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Changed to customerservice@

#### 2. **Email_Trigger_If_Job_Aamended_and_is_a_LMJ** (Job) - üü° PARTIALLY BROKEN
**File:** [Job__c.workflow-meta.xml:68-82](../force-app/main/default/workflows/Job__c.workflow-meta.xml#L68-L82)
**Recipients:**
- ‚úÖ lucas.hargreaves@recyclinglives-services.com (Hardcoded - received emails)
- ‚ùå Account_Owner__c (Dynamic - userLookup - did NOT receive)

**Impact:** Account owners NOT receiving LMJ amendment notifications
**Flow Triggered By:** LMJ_Email_Alert
**Flow Error:** Yes - logged in Salesforce at 19:06 on Oct 15
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Changed to customerservice@

#### 3. **ADOC_Not_Created_Warning** (Job) - üü¢ WOULD WORK
**File:** [Job__c.workflow-meta.xml:3-11](../force-app/main/default/workflows/Job__c.workflow-meta.xml#L3-L11)
**Recipients:**
- ‚úÖ ccEmails: customerservice@recyclinglives-services.com (Hardcoded)

**Impact:** Would work once no-reply@ recreated (hardcoded recipients)
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Changed to customerservice@ (preventive)

#### 4. **Invalid_Depots_Against_Job** (Job) - üü¢ WOULD WORK
**File:** [Job__c.workflow-meta.xml:84-102](../force-app/main/default/workflows/Job__c.workflow-meta.xml#L84-L102)
**Recipients:**
- ‚úÖ alice.ducker@recyclinglives.com (Hardcoded)
- ‚úÖ gareth.layland@recyclinglives.com (Hardcoded)
- ‚úÖ glen.bagshaw@recyclinglives-services.com (Hardcoded)

**Impact:** Would work once no-reply@ recreated (hardcoded recipients)
**Status:** ‚úÖ **FIXED** - Changed to customerservice@ (preventive)

---

## ‚úÖ THE FIX APPLIED

### What Was Done (Oct 15, 2025)

**Action:** Manually updated all 4 email alerts in Salesforce UI

**Changes:**
1. Setup ‚Üí Workflow Actions ‚Üí Email Alerts
2. For each alert:
   - Opened alert configuration
   - Changed "From Email Address" from `no-reply@recyclinglives-services.com` to `customerservice@recyclinglives-services.com`
   - Saved

**Alerts Updated:**
- ‚úÖ Pricing_Generated
- ‚úÖ Email_Trigger_If_Job_Aamended_and_is_a_LMJ
- ‚úÖ ADOC_Not_Created_Warning
- ‚úÖ Invalid_Depots_Against_Job

### Why This Solution Works

**`customerservice@recyclinglives-services.com` has:**
- ‚úÖ `Purpose="UserSelectionAndDefaultNoReply"` - supports dynamic recipients
- ‚úÖ `IsAllowAllProfiles=true` - accessible to all users
- ‚úÖ Already used by other email alerts successfully
- ‚úÖ Professional sender address

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ No code deployment needed (UI changes take effect immediately)
- ‚úÖ Avoids "invalid cross reference id" deployment errors
- ‚úÖ Works for both dynamic AND hardcoded recipients
- ‚úÖ No risk of breaking other workflows using customerservice@
- ‚úÖ Only ONE org-wide address can have UserSelectionAndDefaultNoReply - customerservice@ already has it

### Alternative Considered (Not Chosen)

**Option: Recreate no-reply@ with UserSelectionAndDefaultNoReply**
- ‚ùå Would require removing Purpose from customerservice@
- ‚ùå Would break other workflows using customerservice@ with dynamic recipients
- ‚ùå More risky
- ‚ùå More complex
- ‚ùå Not worth it just to keep "no-reply" as sender name

## üß™ TESTING PLAN

### Test Scheduled: October 16, 2025

**Test Quote:** 0Q0Sj0000012yxBKAQ - "Manningtree - CO11 1UP"
**Current Status:** Pricing Generated

### Test Procedure

1. **Change quote status:**
   ```
   Status: "Pricing Generated" ‚Üí "Pricing Required" ‚Üí "Pricing Generated"
   ```

2. **Verify flow execution:**
   - ‚úÖ Task created with subject "Supplier pricing email sent to sales"
   - ‚úÖ Date_Pricing_Generated__c updated

3. **Verify email sent:**
   ```sql
   SELECT Id, Subject, FromAddress, ToAddress, MessageDate
   FROM EmailMessage
   WHERE Subject LIKE 'Pricing Information Added%'
   AND MessageDate >= TODAY
   ORDER BY MessageDate DESC
   ```
   **Expected:** Email record found with FromAddress = customerservice@

4. **Verify email received:**
   - Katie Alexander confirms receiving email
   - Subject: "Pricing Information Added - Manningtree - CO11 1UP"
   - From: customerservice@recyclinglives-services.com

### Success Criteria

- [  ] Task created ‚úÖ
- [  ] EmailMessage record exists ‚úÖ
- [  ] Email received by Katie ‚úÖ
- [  ] FromAddress = customerservice@recyclinglives-services.com ‚úÖ
- [  ] No flow errors ‚úÖ

## üìà DATA EVIDENCE

### Email Outage Confirmation

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(Id) as TaskCount
FROM Task
WHERE Subject = 'Supplier pricing email sent to sales'
AND CreatedDate >= 2025-09-25T00:00:00Z
-- Result: 205 tasks created
```

```sql
SELECT COUNT(Id) as EmailCount
FROM EmailMessage
WHERE Subject LIKE 'Pricing Information Added%'
AND MessageDate >= 2025-09-25T00:00:00Z
-- Result: 0 emails sent ‚ùå
```

**Conclusion:** 205 tasks created, 0 emails sent = 100% failure rate

### Last Successful Emails (Before Outage)

```sql
SELECT Subject, FromAddress, ToAddress, MessageDate
FROM EmailMessage
WHERE Subject LIKE 'Pricing Information Added%'
ORDER BY MessageDate DESC
LIMIT 5
```

**Results:**
| Date | From | To | Quote |
|------|------|----|----|
| Sept 24, 11:31 | alice.ducker@ | kaylie.morris@ | St. Davids Barracks |
| Sept 24, 11:21 | danny.czepiec@ | supriya.chaterjee@ | Tunbridge Wells GC |
| Sept 24, 11:02 | alice.ducker@ | matthew.pirrie@ | Costa Coffee Macclesfield |

**Pattern:** All from individual user addresses, NOT org-wide addresses

### Katie's Example Quotes

#### Quote 1: "The Grain Silos, Weyhill Road"
- **Quote ID:** 0Q0Sj0000012FnBKAU
- **Date Pricing Generated:** Oct 13, 2025 at 15:20:38
- **Task Created:** ‚úÖ YES (by Alice Ducker)
- **Email Sent:** ‚ùå NO
- **Current Status:** Changed back to "Pricing Request" (Katie gave up waiting)

#### Quote 2: "Manningtree - CO11 1UP"
- **Quote ID:** 0Q0Sj0000012yxBKAQ
- **Date Pricing Generated:** Oct 15, 2025 at 13:43:57
- **Task Created:** ‚úÖ YES (by Alice Ducker)
- **Email Sent:** ‚ùå NO (triggered before fix)
- **Will be used for testing:** Oct 16, 2025

## üö® BUSINESS IMPACT

### Operational Impact

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Outage Duration** | 21 days (Sept 25 - Oct 15) |
| **Quotes Affected** | 205+ |
| **Email Success Rate** | 0% (complete failure) |
| **Sales Reps Affected** | All (~10 users) |
| **Customer Delays** | Unknown (unmeasured) |

### Workflow Breakdown Sequence

1. Supply Chain completes pricing ‚úÖ
2. Supply Chain sets status to "Pricing Generated" ‚úÖ
3. Flow executes ‚úÖ
4. System creates task "Supplier pricing email sent to sales" ‚úÖ ‚Üê **MISLEADING**
5. **Email attempt fails silently** ‚ùå
6. Sales rep never notified ‚ùå
7. Sales rep unaware quote is ready ‚ùå
8. Customer waits indefinitely ‚ùå
9. Potential business lost ‚ùå

### Affected Users (from Task records)

**Most Affected Quote Owners:**
- Joanne Parry (5+ quotes)
- Matthew Pirrie (4+ quotes)
- Ashleigh Taylor (4+ quotes)
- Katie Alexander (3+ quotes)
- Dan Wilson (3+ quotes)
- Jan Ward, Rebekah Stewart, Laura Baron, and others

### Trust & Process Impact

- ‚ùå **False Success Indicator:** Task says "email sent" but wasn't
- ‚ùå **Silent Failure:** No errors, no logs, no alerts for 21 days
- ‚ùå **Misleading Fix:** Oct 7 marked as "resolved" but continued failing
- ‚ùå **Detection Delay:** 13 days before first report, 21 days total
- ‚ùå **Diagnosis Difficulty:** 8 more days to find actual root cause

## üîÑ WHY WORKFLOW EMAIL ALERTS DON'T CREATE EMAILMESSAGE RECORDS

### Important Technical Note

**Workflow email alerts** (triggered by flows) **do NOT create EmailMessage records by default.**

### What Creates EmailMessage Records

| Email Type | Creates EmailMessage? |
|------------|----------------------|
| Workflow Email Alerts | ‚ùå NO |
| Manual "Send Email" from UI | ‚úÖ YES |
| Email-to-Case | ‚úÖ YES |
| Apex with `saveAsActivity=true` | ‚úÖ YES |
| Flow "Send Email" action (with proper config) | ‚úÖ YES |

### Why This Matters

This explains several confusing findings during investigation:

1. **No EmailMessage records for pricing emails** - This is NORMAL for workflow alerts
2. **Can't verify delivery via EmailMessage query** - Must use Task creation + user confirmation
3. **Old EmailMessage records from Sept 24** - Those were from a DIFFERENT email system
4. **Manual "Send Test Email" also creates no record** - Uses same workflow mechanism

### Verification Methods

**For Workflow Email Alerts:**
- ‚úÖ Task creation (indirect indicator)
- ‚úÖ User confirmation ("Did you receive it?")
- ‚ùå EmailMessage query (won't work)

**To Get EmailMessage Records:**
- Replace workflow alert with Flow "Send Email" action
- Or use Apex email sending with `saveAsActivity=true`

## üìö LESSONS LEARNED

### What Went Wrong

1. ‚ùå **Root Cause Misdiagnosis (Oct 7)**
   - Thought: Profile permissions were the issue
   - Reality: Org-wide address Purpose setting was the issue
   - Result: "Fix" applied but problem continued

2. ‚ùå **Inadequate Testing**
   - Only verified task creation (visible indicator)
   - Never verified actual email delivery
   - Never checked EmailMessage table
   - Never confirmed with end user

3. ‚ùå **Misleading Task Subject**
   - Task says "Supplier pricing email sent to sales"
   - Creates false confidence that email was sent
   - Should say "Pricing notification triggered" (more accurate)

4. ‚ùå **No Monitoring**
   - Silent failures went undetected for 21 days
   - No daily checks comparing tasks vs emails
   - No alerts for anomalies

5. ‚ùå **Accidental Deletion**
   - Attempted to change org-wide address Purpose
   - Didn't understand Salesforce's "one address only" limitation
   - Accidentally deleted the address entirely

### What To Change

1. ‚úÖ **Always verify end-to-end delivery**
   - Don't trust intermediate success indicators
   - Check actual outcome (email received)
   - Query EmailMessage table (when applicable)

2. ‚úÖ **Understand Org-Wide Address Settings**
   - `Purpose` setting matters for dynamic recipients
   - Only ONE address can have UserSelectionAndDefaultNoReply
   - Changing Purpose may affect other workflows

3. ‚úÖ **Implement Monitoring**
   - Daily query: Tasks created = Emails sent
   - Alert if mismatch detected
   - Catch failures within 24 hours, not 21 days

4. ‚úÖ **Update Task Subject**
   - Change from "email sent" to "notification triggered"
   - More accurate, less misleading
   - Doesn't imply success when there's failure

5. ‚úÖ **Better Testing Procedures**
   - Test with actual end user
   - Verify in multiple ways (task + email + user confirmation)
   - Don't mark as "resolved" until fully verified

---

## üõ°Ô∏è PREVENTION & MONITORING

### Daily Monitoring Query

**Run this daily to detect failures:**

```sql
-- Count quotes with pricing generated today
SELECT COUNT(Id) as QuotesGeneratedCount
FROM Quote
WHERE Date_Pricing_Generated__c = TODAY

-- Count tasks created today (flow executed)
SELECT COUNT(Id) as TasksCreatedCount
FROM Task
WHERE Subject = 'Supplier pricing email sent to sales'
AND CreatedDate = TODAY

-- Count emails sent today (actual delivery - only if using Send Email action)
SELECT COUNT(Id) as EmailsSentCount
FROM EmailMessage
WHERE Subject LIKE 'Pricing Information Added%'
AND MessageDate = TODAY
```

**Expected Result:** All three counts should match

**Alert Condition:** If QuotesGeneratedCount > TasksCreatedCount OR TasksCreatedCount > EmailsSentCount ‚Üí **Investigate immediately**

### Weekly Health Check

**Verify org-wide email configuration:**

```sql
SELECT Id, DisplayName, Address, Purpose, IsAllowAllProfiles
FROM OrgWideEmailAddress
WHERE Address = 'customerservice@recyclinglives-services.com'
```

**Expected:**
- `Purpose = "UserSelectionAndDefaultNoReply"` ‚úÖ
- `IsAllowAllProfiles = true` ‚úÖ
- Address still exists ‚úÖ

**If anything changes:** Alert admin immediately

### Flow Error Monitoring

**Check for flow errors daily:**

1. Setup ‚Üí Environments ‚Üí Flows
2. Filter by "Quote_Process_1" and "LMJ_Email_Alert"
3. Check "Failed Flow Interviews" count
4. If > 0 ‚Üí Investigate immediately

### Recommended Improvements

1. **Replace Workflow Alerts with Flow "Send Email" actions**
   - Creates EmailMessage records
   - Better error handling
   - More reliable delivery tracking

2. **Add Error Handling to Flows**
   - Catch email send failures
   - Create high-priority task for admin
   - Log failure details

3. **Dashboard Widget**
   - Show daily email success rate
   - Visible to sales managers
   - Quick visual health indicator

4. **Automated Daily Alert**
   - Scheduled Apex job runs at 5 PM
   - Compares tasks vs emails
   - Emails admin if mismatch detected
