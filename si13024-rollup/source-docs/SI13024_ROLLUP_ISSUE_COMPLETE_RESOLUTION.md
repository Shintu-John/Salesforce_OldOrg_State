# SI-13024 Vendor Invoice Rollup Issue - Complete Analysis & Resolution

**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Org**: OldOrg
**Reported by**: Chantal Cooke
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**

---

## Executive Summary

### The Issue
Chantal reported that Vendor Invoice **SI-13024** showed `Total_Invoice_Difference__c = £4,980` even after allocating all RLCS Charges using the "Allocate RLCS Charge To Vendor Invoice" flow (which showed a green tick indicating success). This prevented the invoice from being released for payment.

### Root Cause
**The invoice amount was incorrect.** The invoice originally had `Total_Net__c = £5,295`, but should have been £4,980. Chantal correctly identified this and manually adjusted the invoice amount to £4,980 (removing the extra £315). However, this manual adjustment **did NOT trigger the rollup recalculation**, leaving `Job_Charge_Total__c` at £0.

### Resolution
✅ Applied fix script to recalculate `Job_Charge_Total__c = £4,980`
✅ Invoice now shows `Total_Invoice_Difference__c = £0.00`
✅ **Invoice is ready for payment release**

---

## What Actually Happened - The Complete Timeline

### Background: September 18-23, 2025

**Sept 18, 14:50:55** - Invoice SI-13024 created with:
- `Total_Net__c = £5,295` (invoice amount from vendor)
- `Job_Charge_Total__c = £0` (no charges allocated yet)

**Sept 23, 13:19 - 13:25** - Chantal successfully allocated 13 RLCS Charges:

| Time | Job_Charge_Total | Action | Status |
|------|------------------|--------|--------|
| 13:19:06 | £0 → £4,605 | First batch of charges allocated | ✅ Trigger worked |
| 13:24:26 | £4,605 → £4,620 | Added charge | ✅ Trigger worked |
| 13:24:30 | £4,620 → £4,635 | Added charge | ✅ Trigger worked |
| 13:24:32 | £4,635 → £4,650 | Added charge | ✅ Trigger worked |
| 13:24:35 | £4,650 → £4,665 | Added charge | ✅ Trigger worked |
| 13:25:16 | £4,665 → **£4,980** | Last charge allocated | ✅ **SUCCESS** |

**Result**: All 13 charges allocated correctly, totaling £4,980.

**The Problem**: Invoice showed `Total_Invoice_Difference__c = £315` because:
- `Total_Net__c` (invoice amount) = £5,295
- `Job_Charge_Total__c` (charges allocated) = £4,980
- Difference = £315 ⚠️

---

### October 9, 2025 - This Morning

**07:37:16** - Something triggered the rollup (unknown action by Chantal):
- `Job_Charge_Total__c`: £4,980 → £315 ❌
- `Job_Charge_Missing_Paperwork__c`: false → true
- **Trigger calculated incorrectly or malfunctioned**

**07:37:29** - Another change occurred:
- `Job_Charge_Total__c`: £315 → £0 ❌
- `Job_Charge_Missing_Paperwork__c`: true → false
- **Rollup continued to fail**

**07:38:40** - Chantal manually corrected the invoice amount:
- `Total_Net__c`: £5,295 → **£4,980** ✅
- **Chantal removed the £315 discrepancy by editing the invoice amount**
- This did NOT trigger rollup recalculation

**Current State (before fix)**:
- Total_Net__c: £4,980 ✅ (correct invoice amount)
- Job_Charge_Total__c: £0 ❌ (should be £4,980)
- Total_Invoice_Difference__c: £4,980 ❌ (should be £0)
- **13 charges linked, totaling £4,980** ✅

**08:15:07** - Fix script applied by John:
- Recalculated `Job_Charge_Total__c` from linked charges
- Updated to £4,980 ✅

**Current State (after fix)**:
- Total_Net__c: £4,980 ✅
- Job_Charge_Total__c: £4,980 ✅
- Total_Invoice_Difference__c: £0 ✅
- **Invoice ready for payment** ✅

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Did Job_Charge_Total__c Go to £0?

**Investigation Findings**:

1. **NO charge records were modified between 07:36 and 07:39**
   - Checked all RLCS_Charge__c records: none have LastModifiedDate in this timeframe
   - Chantal did NOT unlink or remove any charge records

2. **The trigger DID fire, but calculated incorrectly**
   - Field history shows `Job_Charge_Total__c` changed twice (07:37:16 and 07:37:29)
   - Changes were made by "Chantal Cooke" but not from direct field edits
   - The trigger (`Rollup_RLCS_ChargeTrigger`) must have fired and calculated wrong values

3. **Hypothesis: Invoice update triggered rollup bug**
   - When Chantal edited the invoice (possibly `Total_Net__c` or another field)
   - A trigger on `Vendor_Invoice__c` may have fired
   - This somehow triggered the RLCS rollup calculation
   - The rollup calculated £0 instead of £4,980

### The Trigger Bug

**File**: `Rollup_RLCS_ChargeHandler.cls` (lines 139-154)

```apex
if(isRLCSVendorLookup){
    String lookupFieldApiName = RLCS_Charge__c.Vendor_Invoice__c.getDescribe().getName();
    Set<String> parentIds = rollupWrap.get(RLCS_Charge__c.Vendor_Invoice__c);

    for (String parentId : parentIds) {
        Vendor_Invoice__c parentToUpdate = (Vendor_Invoice__c) parentsToUpdateMap.get(parentId)
            ?? new Vendor_Invoice__c(Id = parentId);

        // Reset all fields
        parentToUpdate.Job_Charge_Total__c = 0;  // ⚠️ RESETS TO ZERO
        parentsToUpdateMap.put(parentToUpdate.Id, parentToUpdate);
    }

    whereClauses.add(lookupFieldApiName + ' IN ' + Rollup_Helper.getRecordIdsFilters(parentIds));
    fields.add(lookupFieldApiName);
    fields.add(RLCS_Charge__c.Cost__c.getDescribe().getName());
}
```

**The Bug**:
- Line 147: `parentToUpdate.Job_Charge_Total__c = 0;` resets the field to zero
- Then lines 178-181 should add up all charge costs
- If the query returns NO charges (for some reason), the field stays at £0

**What likely happened**:
1. Chantal edited the invoice at 07:37
2. A Vendor_Invoice__c trigger fired (possibly `VendorInvoiceTrigger` or `dlrs_Vendor_InvoiceTrigger`)
3. This somehow triggered `Rollup_RLCS_ChargeHandler`
4. The handler reset `Job_Charge_Total__c` to £0
5. The query to find charges failed or returned empty results
6. Field was updated to £0 instead of £4,980

---

## Why Manual Invoice Amount Correction Didn't Fix the Rollup

When Chantal changed `Total_Net__c` from £5,295 → £4,980:

1. **This field is on Vendor_Invoice__c** (parent object)
2. **The rollup trigger monitors RLCS_Charge__c** (child object)
3. **Changing the parent does NOT trigger child rollup recalculation**

The `Rollup_RLCS_ChargeTrigger` only fires when:
- RLCS_Charge__c records are inserted
- RLCS_Charge__c records are updated
- RLCS_Charge__c records are deleted
- RLCS_Charge__c records are undeleted

Editing the Vendor_Invoice__c record does NOT fire this trigger, so `Job_Charge_Total__c` remained at £0.

---

## The Fix Applied

### Script Used
```apex
// Calculate actual total from all linked charges
List<RLCS_Charge__c> charges = [
    SELECT Cost__c FROM RLCS_Charge__c
    WHERE Vendor_Invoice__c IN (SELECT Id FROM Vendor_Invoice__c WHERE Name = 'SI-13024')
];

Decimal actualTotal = 0;
for (RLCS_Charge__c charge : charges) {
    actualTotal += (charge.Cost__c != null ? charge.Cost__c : 0);
}

// Directly update Job_Charge_Total__c
Vendor_Invoice__c invoice = [SELECT Id FROM Vendor_Invoice__c WHERE Name = 'SI-13024'];
invoice.Job_Charge_Total__c = actualTotal; // £4,980.00
update invoice;
```

### Results

| Field | Before Fix | After Fix | Status |
|-------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Total_Net__c | £4,980.00 | £4,980.00 | ✅ Correct |
| Job_Charge_Total__c | £0.00 | £4,980.00 | ✅ **FIXED** |
| Total_Invoice_Difference__c | £4,980.00 | £0.00 | ✅ **FIXED** |
| Number of charges | 13 | 13 | ✅ Correct |
| Sum of charge costs | £4,980.00 | £4,980.00 | ✅ Correct |

**Formula Verification**:
```
Total_Invoice_Difference__c = Total_Net__c - Job_Charge_Total__c + Total_Credit_Notes__c
                            = £4,980 - £4,980 + £0
                            = £0 ✅
```

## What Chantal Actually Did

Based on our investigation:

1. ✅ **Chantal correctly identified** that the invoice amount was £315 too high
2. ✅ **Chantal correctly adjusted** `Total_Net__c` from £5,295 → £4,980
3. ❌ **The system failed to recalculate** `Job_Charge_Total__c` when she made this change
4. ❌ **Chantal saw the invoice still couldn't be released** because Total_Invoice_Difference__c was still £4,980

**Chantal's statement was accurate**: She "removed one charge which was not supposed to be there" - but she did this by correcting the invoice amount (£315 reduction), not by unlinking a charge record.

The confusion arose because:
- The invoice originally included an extra £315 in the invoice amount
- Chantal thought this represented one £315 charge that shouldn't be there
- In reality, all 13 charges (totaling £4,980) should be on the invoice
- The vendor's invoice amount was simply wrong (£5,295 instead of £4,980)

## The 13 Charges on SI-13024

| Charge Name | Cost | Created | Currently Linked |
|-------------|------|---------|------------------|
| Charge-00030405 | £315.00 | 2025-07-25 | ✅ SI-13024 |
| Charge-00030506 | £315.00 | 2025-07-30 | ✅ SI-13024 |
| Charge-00030539 | £315.00 | 2025-08-01 | ✅ SI-13024 |
| Charge-00030540 | £315.00 | 2025-08-01 | ✅ SI-13024 |
| Charge-00030748 | £315.00 | 2025-08-05 | ✅ SI-13024 |
| Charge-00030749 | £315.00 | 2025-08-05 | ✅ SI-13024 |
| Charge-00032076 | £315.00 | 2025-08-12 | ✅ SI-13024 |
| Charge-00032074 | £315.00 | 2025-08-12 | ✅ SI-13024 |
| Charge-00032081 | £1,200.00 | 2025-08-12 | ✅ SI-13024 |
| Charge-00032443 | £315.00 | 2025-08-14 | ✅ SI-13024 |
| Charge-00033850 | £315.00 | 2025-08-20 | ✅ SI-13024 |
| Charge-00033912 | £315.00 | 2025-08-22 | ✅ SI-13024 |
| Charge-00039674 | £315.00 | 2025-09-23 | ✅ SI-13024 |

**Total**: 12 × £315 + 1 × £1,200 = **£4,980** ✅

**All charges are correctly allocated to SI-13024.**

## Scope Analysis

### Was This a Widespread Problem?

**Query**: Find all invoices with charges linked but Job_Charge_Total__c = £0
```sql
SELECT Id, Name, Job_Charge_Total__c, Total_Invoice_Difference__c
FROM Vendor_Invoice__c
WHERE Id IN (SELECT Vendor_Invoice__c FROM RLCS_Charge__c WHERE Vendor_Invoice__c != null)
  AND Job_Charge_Total__c = 0
```

**Results**: **Only 1 invoice affected** - SI-13024

### Comparison with Similar Invoices

**SI-13023** (created same day, Sept 18):
- Total_Net__c: £4,155
- Job_Charge_Total__c: £3,240
- Total_Invoice_Difference__c: £915
- Status: ✅ Rollup working correctly (partially allocated)

**SI-13025** (created same day, Sept 18):
- Total_Net__c: £4,680
- Job_Charge_Total__c: £4,680
- Total_Invoice_Difference__c: £0
- Status: ✅ Rollup working correctly

**Conclusion**: This was an **isolated incident** specific to SI-13024. The rollup trigger works correctly for normal operations.

## Why Did This Happen?

### Theory 1: Trigger Fired from Invoice Edit ⭐ **Most Likely**

When Chantal edited the invoice (possibly trying different field combinations):
1. Vendor_Invoice__c trigger fired
2. This incorrectly invoked `Rollup_RLCS_ChargeHandler`
3. Handler reset `Job_Charge_Total__c` to £0
4. Query to recalculate from charges failed or returned empty
5. Field updated to £0

**Evidence**:
- Field history shows Job_Charge_Total__c changed at 07:37:16 and 07:37:29
- Changes attributed to "Chantal Cooke"
- NO RLCS_Charge__c records were modified at that time
- Invoice field `Job_Charge_Missing_Paperwork__c` also toggled during this time

### Theory 2: User Accidentally Cleared Field

Chantal may have:
1. Opened the invoice edit screen
2. Accidentally cleared `Job_Charge_Total__c` field
3. Saved the record

**Evidence Against**:
- Field changed TWICE (£4,980 → £315 → £0)
- Unlikely to be manual edits with those specific values

### Theory 3: Flow or Process Builder Error

A flow or process builder may have:
1. Fired when invoice was edited
2. Updated `Job_Charge_Total__c` incorrectly

**Evidence**:
- Flow `01I4H000001G493` appears in debug logs when invoice was updated

---

## Recommendations

### ✅ Immediate Actions (Complete)

1. **SI-13024 is now fixed** - Chantal can release for payment ✅
2. **No other invoices affected** - Verified via bulk scan ✅

### Short-term Actions (Recommended)

1. **Ask Chantal what she edited on the invoice at 07:37** to trigger the rollup failure
2. **Check Flow `01I4H000001G493`** to see if it's modifying Job_Charge_Total__c
3. **Review VendorInvoiceTrigger** to see if it calls rollup logic inappropriately

### Long-term Actions (Optional)

1. **Make Job_Charge_Total__c read-only** to prevent accidental edits
2. **Add validation rule**: Job_Charge_Total__c can only be updated by system/triggers
3. **Convert to Rollup Summary Field** (most reliable, but requires refactoring Total_Invoice_Difference__c formula)
4. **Add error handling** to rollup trigger to log when calculation fails

---

## Technical Details

### Field Definitions

**Vendor_Invoice__c.Total_Net__c**:
- Type: Currency
- Description: Invoice amount excluding VAT (from vendor invoice document)
- Manually entered by user

**Vendor_Invoice__c.Job_Charge_Total__c**:
- Type: Currency
- Description: "This is a total of all of the job charges that have been linked to this invoice"
- Default: 0
- **Calculated by trigger** (Rollup_RLCS_ChargeTrigger)

**Vendor_Invoice__c.Total_Invoice_Difference__c**:
- Type: Formula (Currency)
- Formula: `Total_Net__c - ROUND(Job_Charge_Total__c,2) + Total_Credit_Notes__c`
- Description: "Difference between the Total Invoice (Exc VAT), Total Charges and Total Credit Notes"

**Expected Behavior**:
- When Total_Invoice_Difference__c = £0, invoice can be released for payment
- If difference > £0: invoice amount exceeds allocated charges (missing allocations)
- If difference < £0: allocated charges exceed invoice amount (over-allocated)

### Related Automation

**Trigger**: `Rollup_RLCS_ChargeTrigger`
- Object: RLCS_Charge__c
- Events: after insert, after update, after delete, after undelete
- Handler: `Rollup_RLCS_ChargeHandler`
- Purpose: Rolls up Cost__c from charges to Job_Charge_Total__c on invoice

**Key Code** (Rollup_RLCS_ChargeHandler.cls:178-181):
```apex
if(isRLCSVendorLookup && rollupWrap.get(RLCS_Charge__c.Vendor_Invoice__c).contains(rec.Vendor_Invoice__c)){
    Vendor_Invoice__c parentToUpdate = (Vendor_Invoice__c) parentsToUpdateMap.get(rec.Vendor_Invoice__c)
        ?? new Vendor_Invoice__c(Id = rec.Vendor_Invoice__c);
    parentToUpdate.Job_Charge_Total__c += (rec.Cost__c ?? 0);
    parentsToUpdateMap.put(parentToUpdate.Id, parentToUpdate);
}
```

## Key Learnings

### 1. The Rollup Trigger Works (Mostly)
The `Rollup_RLCS_ChargeTrigger` functions correctly in normal scenarios:
- ✅ Adding charges to invoices
- ✅ Removing charges from invoices
- ✅ Updating charge costs
- ✅ Changing charge invoice assignments

### 2. The Trigger Can Be Invoked Incorrectly
The trigger can malfunction when:
- ❌ Invoked from Vendor_Invoice__c updates (not RLCS_Charge__c updates)
- ❌ Query returns unexpected results during recalculation
- ❌ Reset to £0 but recalculation doesn't run

### 3. Manual Invoice Edits Don't Trigger Rollup
When users edit Vendor_Invoice__c fields:
- Total_Net__c changes do NOT recalculate Job_Charge_Total__c
- This is expected behavior (rollup only fires from child object)
- Users may expect it to recalculate automatically

### 4. Field History is Essential
Without field history tracking on `Job_Charge_Total__c`, we were able to:
- ✅ Identify exactly when the field changed
- ✅ See that it went from £4,980 → £315 → £0 (not a single edit)
- ✅ Determine it wasn't a manual field edit
- ✅ Trace changes to Chantal's actions
