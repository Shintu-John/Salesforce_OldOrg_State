## Executive Summary

**Issue**: Customer service staff unable to add email address to Domestic Customer account, blocking skip booking process.

**Root Cause**: Person Account page layout missing PersonEmail field.

**Resolution**: Added PersonEmail field to "Domestic Customer" page layout.

**Impact**: Fixed immediately; documented for NewOrg prevention.

## The Problem

**Account**: George Williams (Domestic Customer)
**Record Type**: Person Account
**Issue**: No edit option visible for email field on Account record

**Why Skip Booking Was Blocked**:
- Domestic Create Job flow requires email address
- Staff couldn't add email (field not on page layout)
- Order processing blocked

## Person Account Architecture

**Person Accounts** merge Account and Contact into single entity:
- Email stored in `PersonEmail` field (NOT standard Account.Email)
- Requires specific page layout configuration
- Different field access than Business Accounts

## Resolution

**Action**: Added PersonEmail field to page layout

**File Modified**: `force-app/main/default/layouts/Account-Domestic Customer Layout.layout-meta.xml`

**Field Added** (lines 250-253):
```xml
<layoutItems>
    <behavior>Edit</behavior>
    <field>PersonEmail</field>
</layoutItems>
```

**Result**: âœ… Email field now editable on Domestic Customer records
