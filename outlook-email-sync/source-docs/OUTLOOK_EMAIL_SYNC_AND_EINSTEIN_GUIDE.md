## ü§ñ What is Einstein Activity Capture?

**Einstein Activity Capture (EAC)** is Salesforce's modern, intelligent email and calendar sync tool that automatically captures and syncs emails and meetings between your email system (Outlook/Gmail) and Salesforce.

Think of it as a **smart bridge** between your email and Salesforce that:
- Automatically logs emails to the right Salesforce records
- Syncs calendar events/meetings
- Uses AI to suggest which records emails should be related to
- Works in the background without manual effort

---

## üìß What Does It Do?

### 1. **Email Syncing**
- Automatically captures emails you send/receive
- Logs them to relevant Salesforce records (Contacts, Leads, Opportunities, etc.)
- Matches emails to records based on email addresses
- Shows emails in Activity Timeline on Salesforce records

### 2. **Calendar Event Syncing**
- Syncs meetings/appointments from Outlook/Google Calendar
- Creates events in Salesforce linked to proper records
- Two-way sync: Changes in Salesforce reflect in your calendar (and vice versa)
- Tracks who attended meetings

### 3. **AI-Powered Matching**
- Uses Einstein AI to suggest which Salesforce records emails relate to
- Learns from your past behavior
- Automatically associates emails with Opportunities, Cases, Accounts, etc.

### 4. **Relationship Intelligence**
- Identifies new contacts from email signatures
- Suggests creating new leads/contacts
- Maps communication networks
- Shows email engagement metrics

---

## üÜö Old Way vs. New Way

### ‚ùå Old Way (Salesforce for Outlook / Email-to-Salesforce)

**Manual Process:**
```
1. Receive email in Outlook
2. Open Salesforce
3. Find the Contact/Lead
4. Click "Log a Call" or "Send Email"
5. Manually copy email content
6. Save
7. Repeat for EVERY email
```

**Problems:**
- Time-consuming and manual
- Easy to forget
- Inconsistent logging
- Required Outlook add-in installation
- Often buggy

### ‚úÖ New Way (Einstein Activity Capture)

**Automatic Process:**
```
1. Send/receive emails normally in Outlook
2. EAC automatically syncs them to Salesforce
3. AI matches emails to correct records
4. Done! üéâ
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Fully automatic
- ‚úÖ No manual logging needed
- ‚úÖ Works in background
- ‚úÖ AI-powered matching
- ‚úÖ Cloud-based (no add-in needed)
- ‚úÖ More reliable
